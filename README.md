for Java Base Developer Course:

Develop a program for accounting purposes that can perform the following tasks:

Add employees to the staff.
Remove employees from the staff.
Calculate salaries for two categories of employees:
Hourly employees
Sales managers
The addition and removal of employees, as well as methods for displaying the list of employees on the screen and summing up the salaries of all employees, should be located in the Company class.
The program should also include the classes WageEmployee and SalesManager with properties such as id, name, lastName, number of hours worked, and a method for calculating salary.
For hourly employees, there should be a field for hourly rate. The method for calculating their salary should take into account the minimum wage rate.
Sales managers do not have a fixed salary. Their salary is calculated as a percentage of sales volume. However, their salary calculation method should also take into account the minimum wage rate.
The program should be implemented using inheritance properties.
